<h1>My Data Journey</h1>
<p>Here's a summary of my data journey so far, highlighting what I've accomplished and what I'm working on:</p>

<h2>Journey</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Python Libraries:</strong> Explored pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly, altair, sklearn, streamlit, prophet, neural prophet, etc.</li>
  <li><strong>Visualization:</strong> Learned about different graph types and customization with altair, and converting visuals to HTML for deployment. Also used streamlit to create quick web applications.</li>
  <li><strong>Machine Learning:</strong> Developed a Bayesian Network with a novel approach to accurately make prediction profiling on the manufacturing defect and understanding of causality discovery among the intricate interplay interaction of the process variables - real industry project.</li>
  <li><strong>Web Scraping:</strong> Exploring web-scrapping and breaking through the firewalls of reputable websites for data mining.</li>
  <li><strong>Algorithms and Data Types:</strong> Learning about binary search, linear search, array, linked list, big O notation, selection sort, stack, queue, quicksort, hashtable, collisions, load factor, hash function.</li>
  <li><strong>Mathematics:</strong> Exploring Bayesian statistics, hypothesis testing, probability sampling, statistical significance, designing tests, and inferential statistics.</li>
</ul>
  
<h2>Current Focus</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Future Interests:</strong> Interested in learning Rust, MLOps, DevOps, cloud computing, and handling big data with Hadoop and Spark.</li>
  <li><strong>Building Data Pipelines:</strong> Used Python, AWS Lambda, AWS Redshift, CRON scheduling, and encrypting personally identifiable information (PII) data columns.</li>
  <li><strong>Web Development:</strong> Gaining experience in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and AWS for computing, storage, network routing, and authorization.</li>
  <li><strong>Certification:</strong> Targeting to gain datacamp certificates in data engineer and data scientist in May 2024</li>
</ul>
